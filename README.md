Eye tracking for WM focus

* Can we do reliable eye gaze tracking with a webcam?
  * There are some existing projects such as https://github.com/antoinelame/GazeTracking
  * See also http://wiki.cogain.org/index.php/Eye_Trackers
  * Useful implementation info and Python implementation: https://github.com/errollw/EyeTab
  * Two different implementation details: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/26897/TrackEye-Real-Time-Tracking-Of-Human-Eyes-Using-a
  * Several algorithm implementation details: https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~ok11/software.html
* If yes, is it viable to control window focus in a WM using gaze position?

* Interesting paper focused on specialized hardware, with good review section: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08900
