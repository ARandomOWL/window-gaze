Eye tracking for WM focus

* Can we do reliable eye gaze tracking with a webcam?
  * There are some existing projects such as https://github.com/antoinelame/GazeTracking
  * See also http://wiki.cogain.org/index.php/Eye_Trackers
* If yes, is it viable to control window focus in a WM using gaze position?
